            <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted"><p>Madura Island, approximately 5.200 km<sup>2</sup>, is located in the North East of Java Island. It can be accessed by land and sea.</p>
<p>It is known as the island of salt because it is one of the largest salt-producing islands in Indonesia. The ethnic group who inhabits the island is known as the Madurese. However, other ethnics also live here such as Chinese, Javanese, and even Sundanese.</p>
<p>Since long time ago, this island and the people had given a considerable influence on the development of Islam in Indonesia. It is proven by the existence of Islamic inscriptions in many places on this Island. However, this island does not only have the historical value, but also the beauty of nature and culture.</p></h3>

                  <p>Madura might be familiar with Islam, but there are also some heritages from other religions. One of them is Vihara Avalokitesvara located in <em>Dusun Candi, Desa Polagan, Kecamatan Galis, Kabupaten Pamekasan, Madura</em>. This temple, or in Bahasa Indonesia is called <em>Klenteng</em>, is the heritage from Buddhists which might be established in the 1800s. The architecture of the building is very appealing especially its eye-catching color. The dominant color, which is red, can represent the peculiarity of Chinese in Madura.</p>
<p>There is also a mosque for Muslims and a temple for Hindus in this Vihara. The existence of the mosque and the temple inside the Vihara indicates the good how mutual respect among religions in Madura in ancient times. This Vihara becomes one of the destinations that you must visit because you can learn the history of Madura from the perspective of Buddhists in Madura.</p>
<p>To reach the vihara, you can drive a car from Suramadu Bridge for about 3 hours to Pamekasan. It is near Talang Siring Beach. To know more about the details of the Vihara, you may ask the Vihara keeper, who is always ready to give a short guided tour inside the Vihara.&nbsp; The cost of all is almost free. Parking fee, tour guide, and photo area, are free. You may give some of your money for the sanitation and the management of the building, but it is not a must. So, have you convinced yourself to visit this beautiful place?</p>

                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/7 Menara Sembilangan.jpg" alt="">
                  <p>From a distance, the white building looks towering. In the middle of the lonely surrounding area in the form of beach area, the figure and the existence of the building is quite striking. The building is located in the Tanjung Piring, Bangkalan.</p>
<p>The shades of horror are so felt when listening to the lighthouse that turned out to be an ancient building of the Dutch colonial relics. In addition to looking from the style and architecture of the building, there is also an inscription located above the entrance of this lighthouse.</p>
<p>In the inscription written in Dutch it says that this lighthouse was built in 1879 and called the name Z.M. Willem III. There is also a smaller inscription on the back of the gate written in 1879.</p>
<p>The lighthouse was built in the past to help ships from the Netherlands entering from the Java Sea to the Madura Strait to then lean at the port of Tanjung Perak. Today, the lighthouse serves as a means of navigation in Madura Strait by the Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>The circular and the structure of the building is made of very thick iron. Thousands of large nuts and bolts appear to be the adhesive joints between the irons.</p>
<p>In the center of the lighthouse, there is a circular iron pipe hole with a diameter of about two meters. The iron hole works like a manual lift to raise things down from the bottom and vice versa.<br /> This 78-meter-high lighthouse has 16 floors, each floor characterized by two windows on the front and rear. On each floor, there is a black and curved staircase about three meters high. At the bottom end of the staircase, there is a chunk of iron with a simple decorative motif.<br /> Through the window, visitors can observe the panorama around the Sembilangan beach. For some reason, the feel of mystery and horror is felt inside the lighthouse.</p>
<p>Besides, because the atmosphere was quiet and silent, sometimes, a voice seemed to clank and vibrate inside the lighthouse. Perhaps the voices came from the footsteps of the visitors who were inside the lighthouse or vibration at the joints between the iron pipes.</p>
<p>Not to mention the existence of a story that developed in the society with the cases of ghost sightings and other spirits that often reveal his form around this building. From many supernatural creatures, there is a figure of the Dutch people in his old clothes.</p>
<p>Around this Lighthouse, there are trees that provide a beautiful panorama. Many visitors seemed to enjoy the beauty of the atmosphere and panorama there.</p>
<p>There is also a row of stalls selling various types of traditional foods such as <em>rujak lontong</em> and <em>rujak buah</em>. While enjoying the culinary, visitors can enjoy the panoramic view of the beach and the sea in the Madura strait with the traffic flow of large ships.</p>
<p>With the beauty and historical value of the building, Sembilangan Lighthouse area is often used for a filming location, pre-wedding photo shoot and so forth. To enter this lighthouse every visitor is charged entrance fee Rp 1000 and Rp 3000 for each car.</p>
<p>The access road to get to this area is actually quite easy because it is not far and just by following the highway in front of Pondok Pesantren KH. Kholil which is quite famous in Madura. Unfortunately, there is no public transportation access to get there other than using a private vehicle.</p>
<p>Interestingly, people around this lighthouse are more familiar with this building with the title &lsquo;<em>lampu</em>&rsquo;. For the local people, &lsquo;<em>lampu</em>&rsquo; is more popular thank Menara Sembilangan to call this Lighthouse.</p>

                  <p>Ever come to Kuta beach, Bali? Do not be surprised if you come to Sembilan beach. This beach is also often referred by the visitors as a replica of Kuta beach because of the beauty of white sand, coupled with the turquoise sea that is not less beautiful as the international Kuta beach.
